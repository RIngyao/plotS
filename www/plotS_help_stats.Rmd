PlotS is a data visualization tool that places a strong emphasis on visual representations of data. It doesn't offer standalone statistical analysis; instead, statistical methods can only be applied once a graph or visualization is chosen.

Currently there are four commonly used statistical methods:

A. Parameteric methods: 


1. **T-test** - Welch's and Student's test

2. **ANOVA** - one-way and two-way ANOVA


B. Non-parametric methods:

1. **Wilcoxon test** - Rank sum test and Signed-rank test

2. **Kruskal-Wallis test**: It is an alternative to one-way ANOVA test and recommended when the assumptions for the parametric test are not met.
