**_Note_: For transparency and credibility of your research analysis, always report the statistical method and a description of its appropriateness for the data. Record the result in accepted scientific standard, not just p-value. Report effect size in addition to p-value.**

# Table 3. Summary for Kruskal-Wallis test

'.y.' is the y-axis variable; 'n' is the count of sample; 'statistic' is the test used to compute the p-value; 'df' is the degree of freedom; 'p' is the p-value.

# Table 4. Table of effect size. Measures the strength of relationship between variables.

<!-- Eta-squared based on the H-statistic (of Kruskal-Wallis test) used as the measure of effect size. *Formula:* `Eta2[H] = (H - k + 1)/(n - k)`; Where `k` is the number of groups; `n` is the total number of observations. -->
