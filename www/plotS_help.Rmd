#### **Type of file format supported in plotS**

 > It support comma separated file (csv), tab delimited (tsv) and excel sheet file (xls and xlsx)



#### **Must the input data be of only numeric columns?**

> No, data can be a combination of numerical and categorical variables.



#### **Why and when to reshape the data?**

> Reshaping is required depending on the input data so that variables can be compared. In order to represent and compare variables in plotS, the input data must be in **long format** rather than **wide format**. In the example below, _Table 1_ represents the wide format, while _Table 2_ represent the long format. You need to reshape your data if it is in wide format and want to compare between variables (control, treatment1 and treatment2).



_Example_


```{r}
table1 <- data.frame(sample = c( paste0(rep("sample", 3), 1:3) ), control = c(sample(20:50, 3)),
                     treatment1 = c(sample(10:40, 3)), treatment2 = c(sample(30:60, 3)))
# knitr::kable(table1

table1 %>% flextable() %>% autofit() %>% 
add_header(., sample = "Table 1. Typical data with wide format.", top = TRUE) %>%
  merge_at(., i = 1, j = 1:ncol(table1), part = "header") %>%
    align(., i = 1, j = 1:ncol(table1), align = "center", part = "header")

```

<br>
<br>
_Data in the table 1, which is in a wide format, reshaped to long format in table 2._

<br>

```{r}
table2 <- pivot_longer(table1, cols = !sample, names_to = "treatments", values_to = "value")

table2 %>% flextable() %>% autofit() %>% 
add_header(., sample = "Table 2. Data in table 1 reshaped to long format.", top = TRUE) %>%
  merge_at(., i = 1, j = 1:ncol(table2), part = "header") %>%
    align(., i = 1, j = 1:ncol(table2), align = "center", part = "header")

```

#### **What is aesthetic option?**

> Aesthetic options mapped the variables to visual properties - color, shape or line type. It let user customize the visual properties and differentiate between variables. 


#### **Estimating the effect size**

> Effect size is estimated using different R packages.


> - We used **effectsize** package of R to estimate the effect size of _T-test_ and _ANOVA_.


> - **rstatix** package is used for measuring the effect size of _Wilcoxon_ and _Krukal-Wallis tests_.


#### **Does the app save user data?**

> No, after the session ends, all data is deleted.
