**_Note_: For transparency and credibility of your research analysis, always report the statistical method and a description of its appropriateness for the data. Record the result in accepted scientific standard, not just p-value. Report effect size in addition to p-value.** 


# Table 1. Summary of the input data
```{r}
params$table1

# Table 2. Descriptive statistics
```{r}
knitr::kable(params$table2)

# Table 3. Summary for t-test (`r if(params$caption == "welch"){"Welch's test"}else{"Student's test"} `).

'.y.' is the variable used in y-axis; 'group 1 & 2' are the groups compared in the test; 'n' are the sample counts; 'statistic' is the test used to compute the p-value; 'p' is the p-value
```{r }
